# DIGITAL SUBMISSION TICKET

## Why the Project?
The current system for monitoring submissions, exam marks, and student attendance faces significant challenges due to its manual operation. Students moving from place to place to collect signatures from professors, mentors, and class coordinators leads to considerable time wastage. Simultaneously, teachers face the challenging task of signing numerous documents before practical exams and end-semester assessments. This time-consuming process affects students' exam preparation and faculty's ability to plan effectively. To address these issues, the "DIGITAL SUBMISSION TICKET" project emerges as a crucial solution. By introducing a digital platform, teachers can sign documents at their convenience, saving time consumed in manual signatures. Students, in turn, only need to ensure they meet the specified criteria to proceed to their exams. This innovative project not only simplifies the submission process but also improves efficiency, saving time for both students and faculty and promoting a more focused approach to academic preparations.

## What is the Project?
The project revolves around the digitization of the submission ticket management process within the department. The main goal is to shift from a traditional paper-based system to an online web application, making the process faster and more straightforward. The common manual signing of submission tickets by teachers often leads to misplacement and takes up valuable time, especially during critical periods like End-semester and Practical Exams. The implementation of this digital solution aims to eliminate these inefficiencies. The primary focus is on transforming the documentation process, replacing complicated paper sheets with a modern online system. This system will smoothly capture necessary signatures, providing a sustainable and resource-conscious alternative for both students and professors. The essence of the project lies in its dedication to providing an advanced, technology-driven solution to enhance the overall submission ticket management experience.
